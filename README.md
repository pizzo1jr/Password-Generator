# Password Generator 

## Description
A password generator that allows for users to easily create a custom password from 8 characters all the way to 128 characters long using only javascript, html, and css files. If a password is below 8 characters or larger than 128, there will be a prompt stating that the password does not meet the requirements. 

The script.js file holds a majority of the details behind what happens once the button has been pressed on the website.
- the first part of the code shows variables that are needed for a correct password to be created.
- Asks if user would like to have lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numeric characters. Based off of the answers a passwrod will be randomly generated and shown via a prompt.
- Based on the yes or no questions, the password will be generated. HOWEVER, if a user states no for every question, there is a message stating that they will need to choose yes for at least ONE question for the password to be generated. IF this does happen, the loop will run once more until the proper criteria is met.
